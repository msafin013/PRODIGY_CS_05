   - Responsible Disclosure                : If you discover vulnerabilities or security issues while using this tool, follow responsible disclosure practices. 
                                             Report vulnerabilities to the appropriate authorities or entities responsible for the network or software in question.

 4. Educational Use
  
   - Learning and Research                 : This tool is designed to be a learning resource for students, educators, and researchers in the field of cybersecurity 
                                             and networking. It is intended to provide hands-on experience with packet analysis and network security concepts.
   - Lab Environments                      : For educational purposes, it is recommended to use this tool in controlled lab environments where you have
                                             full permission and where the impact of your actions can be contained and monitored.
