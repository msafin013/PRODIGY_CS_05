 1. Software Requirements:
                            - Python Interpreter:
                                                 - Python 3.6 or later.
                                                 - Check if Python is installed by running:
       
                                                             "python3 --version"
       
                            - If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager:
       
                                                              "sudo apt-get install python3"
       

                            - Python Libraries:
                            - Scapy: A library for packet manipulation.
                            - Install using pip:
         
                                                               "sudo apt-get install python3-pip"
                                                               "pip3 install scapy"
         
                            - Pyshark (Optional): For advanced packet analysis.
                            - Install using pip:
         
                                                               "pip3 install pyshark"
         

 2. Network Interface:
                            - Ensure your Linux machine has a network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0).
                            - List available network interfaces:
    
                                                               "ifconfig"
     

 3. Permissions:
                            - Root Access: Required to capture network packets.
                            - Run the script with sudo to grant root privileges:
       
                                                              "sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py"
       

 4. Dependencies (for Pyshark):
                            - TShark: A command-line network protocol analyzer.
                            - Install TShark:
       
                                                             "sudo apt-get install tshark"
       
                            - Ensure TShark is in your systemâ€™s PATH.

 5. Firewall Configuration:
                            - Make sure your firewall is configured to allow packet sniffing. You may need to adjust iptables or ufw settings to avoid blocking traffic.
     


Summary
                  - OS: Linux
                  - Software: Python 3.6+, Scapy, optional Pyshark & TShark
                  - Permissions: Root access via sudo
                  - Network: Access to a network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0) 
                  - Firewall: Proper configuration to allow traffic capture
