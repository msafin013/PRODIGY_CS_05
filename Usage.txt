 3. Running the Tool
   To run the packet sniffer tool, you need to execute it with root privileges to capture network packets:
   
   sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
   
   - Monitor Specific Network Interface:
     If you want to monitor a specific network interface (e.g., eth0), ensure that the script is configured to target that interface, or modify it to specify the desired interface.

 4. Understanding the Output
   The tool will capture and display the following information for each packet:
   - Source IP Address: The IP address of the device that sent the packet.
   - Destination IP Address: The IP address of the device that the packet is intended for.
   - Protocol: The protocol used in the packet (e.g., TCP, UDP).
   - Source and Destination Ports: The port numbers used in the packet (if applicable).
   - Payload Data: The content of the packet, displayed as a string (non-printable characters are handled).





   Example output:
   
   Source IP: 192.168.1.10 -> Destination IP: 192.168.1.1
   Protocol: TCP | Source Port: 443 -> Destination Port: 53987
   Payload: GET / HTTP/1.1
